    <h1>Adam Santilli Lab 1: Intro to HTML </h1>

    <h2> First, the basics</h2>

    <p> You need the following to build your website. </p>

    <ul> 
        <li> HTML and CSS </li>
        <li> Javascript </li>
        <li> Node.js </li>
        <li> And other web development frameworks </li>
    </ul>

    <p> My top 5 favorite albums </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Fetch the Bolt Cutters </li>
        <li> Rare                   </li>
        <li> Manic                  </li>
        <li> Future Nostalgia       </li>
        <li> Chromatica             </li>
    </ol>
    <h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>

    <p> Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text. </p>
    
    <p> Sometimes you want to <strong> strongly emphasize something </strong> in the text.</p>

    <p> Sometimes you want to <em><strong> do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3> Empty Elements </h3>

    <p> Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. <hr>    
    </p>

    <h2> Images </h2>

    <p> Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
    <p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
    <img src='images/images/mochi.gif' width="90" alt="A mochi gif"/>
    <img src='images/images/mochi.jpg' width="90" alt="A mochi jpg"/> 
    <img src='images/images/mochi.png' width="90" alt="A mochi png"/>
    <img src='images/images/mochi.svg' width="90" alt="A mochi svg"/>
